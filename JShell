It is a interactive tool to learn java and prototyping java code.
REPL tool.
It was introduced in JDK9.
You can test individual statements, try out different variations of a method
In verbose JShell mode (enabled with jshell -v), you see more detailed information
Terminating semicolons are automatically added to the end of a complete snippet if not entered.

//Few examples



jshell> 2 + 2
$3 ==> 4
|  created scratch variable $3 : int

jshell> String twice(String s) {
   ...>    return s + s;
   ...> }
|  created method twice(String)

jshell> twice("Ocean")
$5 ==> "OceanOcean"
|  created scratch variable $5 : String



//Overriding functions using JSHELL



jshell> String twice(String s) {
   ...>    return "Twice:" + s;
   ...> }
|  modified method twice(String)
|  update overwrote method twice(String)

jshell> twice("thing")
$7 ==> "Twice:thing"
|  created scratch variable $7 : String


You can set the amount and format of output with the /set feedback command, for example /set feedback concise. 
If you primarily use JShell by pasting from other windows, then you might prefer a feedback mode with no prompt and only error feedback. 
If so, then enter the /set feedback silent command.
